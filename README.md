# Block Entity Extended Rendering

## About

Block Entity Extended Rendering (or BEER for short) is a small mod to make block entities render from further away.

Ever been irritated that chests, banners, signs, etc. stop rendering once you get far enough away? I was, too. Though there is an entity render distance setting in vanilla Minecraft, block entities are unaffected by this setting, instead using a hard-coded 64 blocks.

BEER, however, overrides this. It provides a separate block entity render distance so that, for example, builds requiring banners are visible as intended from further away.

FoundationGames's Enhanced Block Entities mod is highly recommended as well.
