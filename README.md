# Block Entity Extended Rendering

## About

Block Entity Extended Rendering (or BEER for short) is a small mod to make block entities render from further away.

Ever been irritated that chests, banners, signs, etc. stop rendering once you get far enough away? I was, too. Though there is an entity render distance setting in vanilla Minecraft, block entities are unaffected by this setting, instead using a hard-coded 64 blocks.

BEER, however, overrides this. It provides a separate block entity render distance so that, for example, builds requiring banners are visible as intended from further away.

FoundationGames's Enhanced Block Entities mod is highly recommended as well. Note that in most cases, EBE supercedes BEER due to it baking most (but not all) block entity models into regular blocks. I mainly made this mod for banners, as well as for compatibility with mods that add new block entities.
